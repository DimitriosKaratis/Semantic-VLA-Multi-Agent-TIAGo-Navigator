# ROS2 Autonomous Navigation with VLA (Qwen2.5-VL)

This repository contains a **ROS2 Humble** node that enables a **TIAGo Lite** robot to navigate autonomously in a **Webots** simulation environment using real-time Vision-Language-Action (VLA) reasoning.

## 🤖 System Overview

The node integrates a Large Multimodal Model (Qwen2.5-VL) directly into the robot's control loop. It performs high-level visual reasoning to detect obstacles (e.g., trees, furniture) and generates velocity commands (`Twist` messages) to reach a specified goal (e.g. a door).

### Key Components:
* **Perception:** Real-time image acquisition from the `/Tiago_Lite/Astra_rgb/image_color` topic.
* **VLA Reasoning:** Cloud-based inference via HuggingFace for zero-shot obstacle avoidance.
* **Control:** Dynamic mapping of AI decisions (TURN, FORWARD, GOAL) to ROS2 `geometry_msgs/Twist`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Robotics Middleware:** ROS2 Humble
* **Simulation:** Webots R2023b
* **Vision Model:** Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
* **Language:** Python 3.10
* **CV Bridge:** OpenCV for ROS image transformation

## 🚀 Setup & Execution

1. **Source ROS2 Environment:**
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   ```

2. **Launch Webots Simulation:**
   ```bash
   ros2 launch webots_ros2_tiago robot_launch.py
   ```
   
3. **Start Visualization (Optional)**:   
   ```bash
   ros2 run foxglove_bridge foxglove_bridge
   ```
   Then, open the Foxglove Studio and connect to localhost.

4. **Run the AI Navigator Node:**
   ```bash
   python3 tiago_ai_navigator.py
   ```


## 🎥 Logic Flow & Decision Making

The node operates in a continuous loop:

1. **Subscribe:** Captures raw RGB frames from the TIAGo Astra camera topic.
2. **Inference:** Sends the image and prompt to the VLA model (Qwen2.5-VL) to classify the scene.
3. **Actuate:** * **TURN:** If an obstacle (e.g., tree) is detected (Angular Velocity = 1.0 rad/s).
    * **FORWARD:** If the path to the door is clear (Linear Velocity = 0.2 m/s).
    * **GOAL:** Mission complete once the target is reached.
